📌 Overview

HybridCluster ShopLocator is a hybrid clustering–based retail market segmentation and shop location evaluation system designed for the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR).

It integrates:

🗺 Geospatial data (lat/lon, distance to hubs)

👥 Demographics (population, literacy, worker ratios)

🛍 Business features (shop category, revenue)

to generate meaningful and geographically contiguous market clusters, helping retailers answer:

📍 “Where should I open my shop for maximum success?”

The system leverages SCHC, Gower+HDBSCAN, Spectral, and K-Means, with a predictive Random Forest model to classify new locations.

🎯 Market Segment Predictor

A RandomForestClassifier predicts the market segment of any new shop, based on:

Shop category

Expected revenue

Automatically enriched demographic & geospatial attributes

✔ Helps shop owners evaluate new retail locations quickly.

🔮 Future Scope

🇮🇳 Extend project to pan-India retail segmentation

🛰 Integrate Google Places API for real-time competition detection

☁ Deploy as a web application with interactive map

📱 Build Android app for shop owners

🤖 Add LLM-based recommendations (e.g., “best shop type for this area”)
